Adds support for Samsung SmartThings (2018 only) Zigbee sensors

Very very beta. Note that I do not own any other SmartThings sensors so I'm unable to actively develop for those.

I bought a SmartThings kit on vacation in USA and want to use those Zigbee sensors with my Homey

Currently not listed in the Homey store.

To use, install node

Then run npm install -g athom-cli
