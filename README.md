Adds support for Samsung SmartThings sensors

Very very beta.

I bought a SmartThings kit on vacation in USA and want to use those Zigbee sensors with my Homey

Currently not listed in the Homey store.

To use, install node

Then run npm install -g athom-cli

Then run athom login

and athom app install
